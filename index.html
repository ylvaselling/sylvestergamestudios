      <p>We do not collect any data in the game. No third-party is used that collects data either. The game utilizes the TrueDepth API provided by Apple. The TrueDepth API collects information about face pose and blend shapes, which are collected in order to know the position and rotation of the face of the player, and which facial expression the player has. The facial expression and the pose of the face (position and rotation) are the variables that are used to play the game. The information is only collected and used while playing the game, since it enables playing the game. The information is not stored, nor is it shared with a third party.</p>
